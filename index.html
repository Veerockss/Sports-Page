                            Cricket is also one of the best sports in the world!! Cricket might be very hard to understand at first but when you get the rules and how it works, it can be an exremely fun game to watch and play. Cricket has a lot of action. Cricket is played between two teams of eleven players each. One team, which is batting, tries to score runs, while the other team is fielding, and tries to prevent this. The good thing about cricket is that you can just smack the ball everywhere of you bat. All you need to know is that the bowler bowls, but doesn't chuck to the bastman and the bastman has to hit the ball and run. If the ball crosses the boundary, its four runs and over the boundary is six runs. There are multiple and huge ways to get out but overall, cricket is an enjoyable game that you should try playing.
